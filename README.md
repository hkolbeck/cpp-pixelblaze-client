# Pixelblaze.ino
## An Arduino-focused C++ library for the Pixelblaze LED controller's websocket API
### Status: Not even alpha.

Information about the Pixelblaze can be found at https://electromage.com. Needless to say I think they're pretty neat.

This builds extensively off of @zranger1's Python library: https://github.com/zranger1/pixelblaze-client, but its 
operation is fundamentally different. Where the python client is largely synchronous, I wanted to be able to fire and
forget with eventual updates or register handlers for events that come in with no request issued.

In general, the client works in three ways depending on the operation:
 - "set" operations: fire and forget with no completion-ack possible, only assurance is that the message was acked by 
   the Pixelblaze
 - "get" operations: send a request, passing along a handler to be invoked when or if a response is received. That
   handler will be passed the most parsed and annotated version of the data possible.
 - "watch" operations: The pixelblaze can send hundreds of events per second to connected clients with no prompting.
   If you're interested in for instance, notifications of pattern changes, you need a watcher.


## Right now the Pixelblaze can play a playlist or shuffle everything, let's (awkwardly) shuffle the playlist!

```C++
#include <Arduino.h>
#include <WiFi.h>
#include "../src/PixelblazeClient.h"
#include "../src/PixelblazeMemBuffer.h"

// #define WIFI_SSID "my-wifi"
// #define WIFI_PW "hunter2"
#include "wifi_secrets.h"

#define WEBSOCKET_HOST "192.168.4.1"
#define WEBSOCKET_PORT 81
#define PLAYLIST_DURATION_MS 30000

static size_t playlistLen = 0;
class PlaylistChangeWatcher : public PixelblazeWatcher {
public:
    void handlePlaylistChange(PlaylistUpdate &playlistUpdate) override {
        playlistLen = playlistUpdate.numItems;
    }
};

void extractPlaylistLen(Playlist& playlist) {
    playlistLen = playlist.numItems;
}

PixelblazeClient *pbClient = nullptr;
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    while (!Serial);

    WiFiClient wifi;
    WebSocketClient wsClient = WebSocketClient(wifi, WEBSOCKET_HOST, WEBSOCKET_PORT);
    WiFi.begin(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PW);
    delay(1000);
    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        Serial.print("Wifi status: ");
        Serial.println(WiFi.status());

        WiFi.begin(WIFI_SSID, WIFI_PW);
        delay(1000);
    }

    Serial.println("Wifi connected!");

    PixelblazeMemBuffer buffer = PixelblazeMemBuffer();
    PlaylistChangeWatcher watcher = PlaylistChangeWatcher();
    pbClient = new PixelblazeClient(wsClient, buffer, watcher);
    pbClient->begin();

    // Fetch a value and store it elsewhere. On non-AVR boards this can now use closures!
    pbClient->getPlaylist(extractPlaylistLen) || Serial.printlin(F("Get playlist failed to dispatch"));
    
    // Make sure we're using a paused playlist
    pbClient->setSequencerMode(SEQ_MODE_PLAYLIST) || Serial.printlin(F("Set sequencer mode failed to dispatch"));
    pbClient->pauseSequence() || Serial.printlin(F("Pause failed to dispatch"));
}

uint32_t lastShuffle = millis();
void loop() {
    // The heart of the library's operation. Must be called a few times a second at least if the attached
    // Pixelblaze is sending frame previews. Otherwise the more often the better, if there's nothing to do it will
    // return almost immediately
    pbClient->checkForInbound();
    
    if (playlistLen > 0 && millis() - lastShuffle > PLAYLIST_DURATION_MS) {
        pbClient->setPlaylistIndex(random(0, playlistLen));
        lastShuffle = millis();
    }

    delay(100);
}
```


Confession
----------
This is the first real C++ I've written in 12 years, and it shows. This looks like Java, and that's because that's what 
I spent most of those 12 years writing. In particular my understanding of changes to the C++ language is very new, and
my instinct for memory is coming more from the (to me) sunnier fields of Rust. Both of those may contribute to 
over-complication and memory leaks. I'm happy to hear constructive feedback on most things.
